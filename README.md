# *Cryptography*
This is a basic project made on the concept of **Cryptography** of Cyber Security.
This repository contains the source code of **Encrypted and Unencrypted chatting system** and **GUI(Graphical User Interface) for Encryption-Decryption Messages**.

*FEATURES OF ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION*

    1. Provides security from the Middle-Man Attack.
    2. Encryption is essential to keep private information, messages, and financial transactions private and secure in a digital world.
    3. It focuses on the Confidentiality Integrity of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted over the internet and Availability for Network Security.

## GUI [GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE FOR ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION]: 

## Demo
1) 1st click on the text field of "Message" button and type the message.
2) Type the key and its the password for decoding so keep it in mind.
3) Select the mode as "e" for encryption and "d" for decryption, for this case type "e".
4) Then click on the "Show Message" button.
5) In the text field of Result a "Cipher Text" will be generated, copy that and click on the "Reset" button.
6) Now in the place of "Message" button paste the Cipher Text.
7) Type the key inputted before.
8) For this time the mode will be "d", type that and click on "Show Message" button.
9) You can view the normal text in the text field of "Result".
10) You can click "Exit" button as well as can continue with the process.
