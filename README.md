# *Cryptography*
This is a basic project made on the concept of **Cryptography** of Cyber Security.
This repository contains the source code of **Encrypted and Unencrypted chatting system** and **GUI(Graphical User Interface) for Encryption-Decryption Messages**.

*FEATURES OF ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION*

    1. Provides security from the Middle-Man Attack.
